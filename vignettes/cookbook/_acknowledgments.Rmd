## Acknowledgments

The afcharts package is based on the [sgplot](https://scotgovanalysis.github.io/sgplot/index.html) package, written by Alice Hannah.

This cookbook and the examples it contains have been inspired by the [BBC Visual and Data Journalism cookbook for R graphics](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/) and their [bbplot](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot) package.

The data used throughout the cookbook is from [gapminder](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gapminder).
