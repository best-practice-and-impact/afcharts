afcharts is an R package for creating accessible plots by the Government Analysis Function. Currently, functions are available for styling ggplot2 plots.

The package has been developed using the [Government Analysis Function Data Visualisation guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/). afcharts should be used in conjunction with these guidance documents.

More information about the package and its functions can be found on the [afcharts website](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcharts/). In particular, the [cookbook](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcharts/articles/cookbook.html) contains lots of examples.

## Installation

### Install from CRAN

Install the latest release version of afcharts directly from CRAN:

``` {r install from CRAN, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("afcharts")
```


### Install from GitHub

afcharts can be installed directly from GitHub.

``` {r install from GitHub, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  "best-practice-and-impact/afcharts",
  upgrade = "never",
  build_vignettes = TRUE,
  dependencies = TRUE
)
```

## Getting Started

Once installed, afcharts can be loaded using the `library()` function:

``` r
library(afcharts)
```

Help files for each function in the package can be found on the [References](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcharts/reference/) page of the package website. Alternatively, type `?function_name` into the RStudio console. For example:

``` r
?theme_af()
```

### Use afcharts as default

The easiest way to use afcharts is by adding `use_afcharts()` to the beginning of your R script, Rmarkdown document or Shiny app code. This function will set a number of defaults to ggplot2 geoms, use afcharts colour palettes and use `theme_af()`.

#### Example 1: Plot with one colour using ggplot2 defaults

```{r ex1, fig.alt = ex1_alt}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
library(afcharts)

gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007 & continent == "Europe") |>
  slice_max(order_by = lifeExp, n = 5) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(country, -lifeExp), y = lifeExp)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Iceland has the highest life expectancy in Europe",
    subtitle = "Life expectancy in European countries, 2007",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  )
```

#### Example 2: Plot with one colour using afcharts defaults

```{r ex2, fig.alt = ex2_alt}
afcharts::use_afcharts()

gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007 & continent == "Europe") |>
  slice_max(order_by = lifeExp, n = 5) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(country, -lifeExp), y = lifeExp)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    title = "Iceland has the highest life expectancy in Europe",
    subtitle = "Life expectancy in European countries, 2007",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  )
```

**Note on use of titles, subtitles and captions** <br> Titles, subtitles and captions have been embedded in these example charts for demonstration purposes. However, for accessibility reasons, it is usually preferable to provide titles in the body of the page rather than embedded within the image of the plot. More information is available in the [accessibility article](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcharts/articles/accessibility.html#other-accessibility-considerations).
